	<![CDATA[
		A bitstring is called 00-<em>free</em> if it does not contain two 0's next to each other.
		In class, we have seen that for any $m \geq 1$, the number of 00-free
		bitstrings of length $m$ is equal to the $(m + 2)$-th Fibonacci number $f_{m+2}$. <br>
		
		What is the number of 00-free bitstrings of length 20 that have 0 at position 7?
		(The positions are numbered $1,2,\dots,20$.)
