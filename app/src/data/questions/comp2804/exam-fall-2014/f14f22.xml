	<![CDATA[
		I flip a fair coin, independently, 6 times, resulting in a sequence of heads ($H$) and tails ($T$).
		For each (consecutive) $HTH$ in this sequence, you win \$5.
		Define the random variable $X$ to be the amount of dollars that you win. For example, if the
		sequence is
		$$
			THTHTH,
		$$
		then $X = 10$. What is the expected value of $X$?
