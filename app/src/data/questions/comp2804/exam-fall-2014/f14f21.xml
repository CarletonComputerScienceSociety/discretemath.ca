	<![CDATA[
		I flip two fair and independent coins. If the first coin comes up tails, you lose \$1 (i.e., you win -\$1).
		If the second coin comes up heads, you win \$2. (Thus, if the first coin comes up tails and the second coin
		comes up heads, you win \$1.) Define the random variable $X$ to be the amount of dollars that you win. 
		What is the expected value of $X$?
