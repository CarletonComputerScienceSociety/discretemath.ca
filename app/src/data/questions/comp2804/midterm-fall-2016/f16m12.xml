		Let $n \geq 1$ be an integer, and let $S_n$ be the number of ways in which $n$ can be written
		as a sum of 3s and 4s, such that the order in which the 3s and 4s occur in the sum matters.
		For example, $S_5 = 0$, because 5 cannot be written as a sum of 3s and 4s.
		We have $S_{11} = 3$, because
		
		<table style="margin: 1rem auto;">
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td style="vertical-align: top;">$11$</td>
					<td>
						$= 3 + 4 + 4 = 4 + 3 + 4$
						$= 4 + 4 + 3.$
					</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>
		
		Which of the following is true for any $n \geq 5$?
