	<question><![CDATA[
		A bitstring is called 00-<em>free</em>, if it does not contain two 0's next to each other.
		In class, we have seen that for any $m \geq 1$, the number of 00-free bitstrings of length $m$
		is equal to the $(m + 2)$-th Fibonacci number $f_{m+2}$. <br>
		What is the number of 00-free bitstrings of length 20 that have 1 at position 11 and 0 at
		position 20? (The positions are numbered $1,2,...,20$.)
