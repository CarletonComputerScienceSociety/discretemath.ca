		You are given a fair red die and a fair blue die. Consider the following experiment:
		<p style="text-align: center;">Experiment: Roll each die once and take the sum of the two rolls.</p>
		You repeat this experiment until the sum of the two rolls is equal to 7. <br>
		Consider the random variable
		
		[defs]
			X = the number of times you do the experiment.
		[/defs]
		
		(This value $X$ includes the experiment in which the sum is 7 for the first time.) <br>
		What is the expected value $\mathbb{E}(X)$ of the random variable $X$?
