	<![CDATA[
		Consider a bitstring of length 77, in which each bit is 0 with probability 1/3 (and, thus, 1 with
		probability 2/3), independently of the other bits. What is the probability that there are exactly
		15 0s in this bitstring?

	<answer correct="true">${77 \choose 15}(1/3)^{15}(2/3)^{62}$</answer>
	<answer correct="false">${77 \choose 15}((1/3)^{15} + (2/3)^{62})$</answer>
	<answer correct="false">${77 \choose 15}(1/3)^{62}(2/3)^{15}$</answer>
	<answer correct="false">${77 \choose 15}((1/3)^{62} + (2/3)^{15})$</answer>
