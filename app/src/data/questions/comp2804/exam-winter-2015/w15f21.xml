	<![CDATA[
		Consider a bitstring of length 5, in which each bit is 0 with probability 1/2 (and, thus, 1 with
		probability 1/2), independently of the other bits. Define the random variables $X$ and $Y$ as
		follows:
		[defs]
		  X = the number of 0s in this bitstring
		[/defs]
		and
		[defs]
		  Y = the value of the first bit in this bitstring.
		[/defs]
		Which of the following is true?
