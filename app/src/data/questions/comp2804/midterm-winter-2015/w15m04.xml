		Consider strings consisting of the characters $a$, $b$, and $c$. Such a string is called <em>valid</em>,
		if no two consecutive characters are equal. Thus, $abacbac$ is valid, whereas $abaccac$ is not
		valid. <br>
		
		Let $n \geq 1$ be an integer and let $V_n$ be the number of valid strings of length $n$. Which of
		the following is true?
