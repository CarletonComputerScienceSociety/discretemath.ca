	<![CDATA[
		You are given two bitstrings $a_1,a_2,\dots,a_{77}$ and $b_1,b_2,\dots,b_{77}$ of length 77. In
		both bitstrings, each bit is 0 with probability 3/4, and 1 with probability 1/4 (independent of
		all other bits). <br>
		
		Consider the string
		$$
			a_1-b_1,a_2-b_2,\dots,a_{77}-b_{77}.
		$$
		What is the probability that each element in this string is non-zero?
