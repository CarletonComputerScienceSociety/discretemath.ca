		Let $n \geq 2$ be an integer. You are given $n$ beer bottles $B_1,B_2,\dots,B_n$ and one cider
		bottle $C$. Consider a uniformly random permutation of these $n+1$ bottles. The positions in this
		permutation are numbered as $1,2,3,\dots,n+1$. Define the random variable $X$ to be
		[defs]
		  X = the position of the leftmost beer bottle.
		[/defs]
		What is the expected value $\mathbb{E}(X)$ of the random variable $X$?
