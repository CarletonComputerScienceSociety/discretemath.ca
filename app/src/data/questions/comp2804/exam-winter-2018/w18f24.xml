		Elisa Kazan has successfully completed her second year as President of the Carleton Computer Science Society.
		In order to celebrate this, Elisa throws a party. She invites 15 students; thus, the total number of students
		at the party is equal to 16. Elisa has brought an unlimited amount of drinks: 5 types $C_1,C_2,C_3,C_4,C_5$
		of cider and 3 types $B_1,B_2,B_3$ of beer. Each of the 16 students gets 3 drinks; each of these drinks is
		uniformly, and independently, chosen from the 8 types of drinks. <br>
		Define the following random variable $X$:
		[defs]
		  X = the number of students who get exactly 2 ciders.
		[/defs]
		What is the expected value $\mathbb{E}(X)$ of the random variable $X$? <br>
		<em>Hint:</em> Use indicator random variables.
