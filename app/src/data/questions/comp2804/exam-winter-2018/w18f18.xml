		<!-- yes, i'm aware of the cases environment. the strings are sufficiently long i need them to word wrap on mobile -->
		<table style="margin: 1rem auto;">
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td rowspan="2">$X = \bigg\{$</td>
					<td>$1\ $</td>
					<td>if the red coin flip resulted in heads$,$</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>$0\ $</td>
					<td>if the red coin flip resulted in tails$,$</td>
