		Let $n$ and $k$ be integers such that $n$ is even, $n \geq 2$, and $1 \leq k \leq n$. <br>
		The Carleton Computer Science Society (CCSS) is having their annual <s>Christmas</s> Holiday Season Party, which
		is attended by $n$ students.

				<tr>
					<td style="vertical-align: top; text-align: right; padding: 0;">(a)</td>
					<td style="padding: 0 0 0 0.35em;">
						$k$ of these $n$ students are politically correct and, thus, refuse to say <em>Merry Christmas</em>.
						Instead, they say <em>Happy Holidays</em>.

					<td style="padding: 0 0 0 0.35em;">
						$n - k$ of these $n$ students do not care about political correctness and, thus, they say
						<em>Merry Christmas</em>.

		Consider a uniformly random permutation of these $n$ students. The positions in this permutation are numbered
		as $1,2,...,n$. <br>
		
		Define the following random variable $X$:
		[defs]
		  X = the number of positions $i$ with $1 \leq i \leq \left. n \middle/ 2 \right.$ such that both students at positions $i$ and $2i$ are politically correct.
		[/defs]
		
		What is the expected value $\mathbb{E}(X)$ of the random variable $X$? <br>
		<em>Hint:</em> Use indicator random variables.
