		Let $n \geq 1$ be an integer and let $S_n$ be the number of ways in which $n$ can be written as a
		sum of 2's and 4's; the order in which the 2's and 4's occur in the sum matters. For example, $S_6 =
		3$, because
		$$
			6 = 2 + 2 + 2 = 2 + 4 = 4 + 2.
		$$
		Which of the following is true for any integer $n \geq 6$?
