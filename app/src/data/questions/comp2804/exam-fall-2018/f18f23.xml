	<![CDATA[
		The final exam for COMP 2804 has 25 multiple-choice questions. For each question, there are 4
		possible answers, exactly one of which is correct. Michiel chooses a positive real number $z$ and
		uses the following marking scheme: For each correct answer, a student receives 1 mark, whereas for
		each incorrect answer, the student receives $-z$ marks. <br>
		
		Jim is one of the students and answers the 25 questions, by choosing a uniformly random answer for
		each question; the choices are independent of each other. <br>
		
		Define the random variable
		[defs]
		  X = the number of marks that Jim recevies.
		[/defs]
		For what value of $z$ is the expected value $\mathbb{E}(X)$ equal to 0? <br>
		
		<em>Hint:</em> Use the Linearity of Expectation.
