	<question>
		Assume you write a multiple-choice exam that has 25 questions. For each question, four options are given
		to you, and exactly one of these options is the correct answer. Assume that you answer each question
		uniformly at random, where the choices for different questions are independent of each other. What is the
		probability that you have exactly 17 correct answers?
	</question>
	<answer correct="false">${25 \choose 17} \cdot \left( 1 \middle/ 4 \right)^{17}$</answer>
	<answer correct="false">${25 \choose 17} \cdot \left( 3 \middle/ 4 \right)^{17}$</answer>
	<answer correct="true">
		${25 \choose 17} \cdot \left( 1 \middle/ 4 \right)^{17} \cdot \left( 3 \middle/ 4 \right)^8$
	</answer>
	<answer correct="false">
		${25 \choose 17} \cdot \left( 1 \middle/ 4 \right)^8 \cdot \left( 3 \middle/ 4 \right)^{17}$
	</answer>
