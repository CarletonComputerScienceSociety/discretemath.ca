	<![CDATA[
		I flip a fair coin, independently, 10 times, resulting in a sequence of heads ($H$) and tails ($T$).
		For each $HT$ in this sequence, you win \$3.
		Define the random variable $X$ to be the amount of dollars that you win. For example, if the
		sequence is
		$$
			HHTTHTTHTT,
		$$
		then $X = 9$. What is the expected value of $X$?
