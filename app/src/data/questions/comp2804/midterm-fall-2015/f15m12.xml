		Let $n \geq 1$ be an integer and let $S_n$ be the number of ways in which $n$ can be written as a
		sum of 1s and 2s, such that
		<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0;">
			<li>
				the order in which the 1s and 2s occur in the sum matters, and
			</li>
			<li>
				it is not allowed to have two consecutive 2s.
			</li>
		</ul>
		For example, if $n = 7$, then both
		$$
			7 = 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1
		$$
		and
		$$
			7 = 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1
		$$
		are allowed, whereas
		$$
			7 = 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1
		$$
		is not allowed. <br>
		
		Which of the following is true?
