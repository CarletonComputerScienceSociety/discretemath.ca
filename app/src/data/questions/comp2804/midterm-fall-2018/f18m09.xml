		A bitstring $s_1s_2...s_n$ is called a <em>palindrome</em>, if $$s_1s_2...s_{n-1}s_n = s_ns_{n-1}...s_2s_1,$$
		i.e., reading the string from left to right gives the same string as when reading from right to left. <br>
		
		For any integer $n \geq 1$, let $P_n$ be the number of bitstrings of length $n$ that are palindromes. <br>
		
		Which of the following is true for any integer $n \geq 3$?
