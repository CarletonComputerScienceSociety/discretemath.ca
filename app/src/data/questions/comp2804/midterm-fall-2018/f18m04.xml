		Elisa Kazan's neighborhood pub serves 8 different types of cider; denote these types by $C_1,C_2,\dots,C_8$.
		Elisa invites 7 friends to this pub and orders one cider for each friend. Different
		friends may get the same type of cider. (Elisa came by car and, therefore, orders a glass of water
		for herself.) <br>
		In how many ways can Elisa place these orders of cider, such that exactly 4 of her friends get a
		cider of type $C_3$?
