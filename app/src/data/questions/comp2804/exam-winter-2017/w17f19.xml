		Let $n \geq 3$ be an integer and consider a group $P_1,P_2,\dots,P_n$ of $n$ people. Each of these
		people has a uniformly random birthday, which is independent of the birthdays of the other people.
		We ignore leap years; thus, the year has 365 days. <br>
		
		Define the random variable $X$ to be the number of unordered triples $\{P_i,P_j,P_k\}$ of people
		(i.e., subsets consisting of three people) that have the same birthday. <br>
		
		What is the expected value $\mathbb{E}(X)$ of $X$? <br>
		<em>Hint:</em> Use indicator random variables.
