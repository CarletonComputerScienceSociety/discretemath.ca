		In this question, we consider bitstrings of length $n$, where $n$ is an even integer, and in which
		the positions are numbered $1,2,\dots,n$. <br>
		
		For any even integer $n$, let $S_n$ be the number of bitstrings of length $n$ that have both of the
		following two properties:
		<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0;">
			<li>
				There is a 0 at every even position.
			</li>
			<li>
				The entire bitstring does not contain the substring 101.
			</li>
		</ul>
		Which of the following is true for all even integers $n \geq 6$?
