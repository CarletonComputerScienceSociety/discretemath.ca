	<![CDATA[
		A bitstring is called 00-<em>free</em>, if it does not contain two 0's next to each other.
		In class, we have seen that for any $m \geq 1$,
		the number of 00-free bitstrings of length $m$ is equal to the $(m+2)$-th Fibonacci number
		$f_{m+2}$. <br>
		What is the number of 00-free bitstrings of length 77 that have 0 at position 59? (The positions are numbered $1,2,\dots,77$.)
