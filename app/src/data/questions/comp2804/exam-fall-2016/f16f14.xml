	<![CDATA[
		We flip a fair coin three times; these flips are independent of each other. These three coin flips
		give us a sequence of length three, where each symbol is $H$ or $T$. Define the events (recall that
		0 is even):
		[defs]
		  A = "the number of $H$ in the sequence is even",
		  B = "the sequence contains at least two consecutive $H$'s".
		[/defs]
		Which of the following is true?
