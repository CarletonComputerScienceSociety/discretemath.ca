	<![CDATA[
		Let $n \geq 2$ be an integer and consider a group $P_1,P_2,\dots,P_n$ of $n$ people.
		Each of these people has a uniformly random birthday, which is independent of the birthdays of the
		other people. We ignore leap years; thus, the year has 365 days. <br>
		
		Define the random variable $X$ to be the number of unordered pairs $\{P_i,P_j\}$ of people that have
		the same birthday. <br>
		
		What is the expected value $\mathbb{E}(X)$ of $X$? <br>
		<em>Hint:</em> Use indicator random variables.
