		Let $n$ be an integer with $n \geq 3$. Consider a bitstring of length $n$, in which each bit is 0
		with probability 1/3 (and, thus, 1 with probability 2/3), independently of the other bits. Let
		$X$ be the number of occurrences of 010 in this bitstring. For example, if the bitstring is
		$$
			0010100100,
		$$
		then $X = 3$. <br>
		
		What is the expected value $\mathbb{E}(X)$ of $X$? <br>
		<em>Hint:</em> Use indicator random variables.
