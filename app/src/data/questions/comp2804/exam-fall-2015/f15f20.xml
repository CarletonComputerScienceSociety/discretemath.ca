	<![CDATA[
		You repeatedly, and independently, flip three fair coins, until there are exactly two heads among
		the three flips. Define the random variable $X$ to be the total number of coin flips.
		For example, if the coin flips result in
		$$
		(TTT), (THT), (HHH), (HTH),
		$$
		then $X = 12$. <br>
		
		What is the expected value $\mathbb{E}(X)$ of $X$?
