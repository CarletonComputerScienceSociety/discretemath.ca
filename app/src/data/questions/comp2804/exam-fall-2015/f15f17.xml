		You are given that:
		<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0;">
			<li>
				The course COMP 9999 runs over a period of one year, starting on January 1 and ending on December
				31. There is one lecture every day; thus, the total number of lectures is 365.
			</li>
			<li>
				At the beginning of each of the 365 lectures, Nick flips a fair and independent coin twice.
				If the coin comes up heads twice, then Nick eats 3 bananas during the lecture; otherwise,
				Nick eats 5 bananas during the lecture.
			</li>
		</ul>
		
		Let $X$ be the total number of bananas that Nick eats during the 365 lectures of the course COMP
		9999. What is the expected value $\mathbb{E}(X)$ of $X$? <br>
		(n.b., you may find it useful to apply Linearity of Expectation)
