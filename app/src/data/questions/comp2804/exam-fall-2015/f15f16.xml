		<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0;">
			<li>
				The course COMP 9999 runs over a period of one year, starting on January 1 and ending on December
				31. There is one lecture every day; thus, the total number of lectures is 365.

				3.

				chosen days. (It is possible that there is a quiz on January 1.)
